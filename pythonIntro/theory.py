# Introduction to Python
# -------------------------------

# 1. What is Python?
#    - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
#    - It is known for its simplicity and readability.
#    - Python supports multiple programming paradigms:
#        * Procedural
#        * Object-Oriented
#        * Functional
#    - Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

# 2. Features of Python:
#    - Easy to learn and read (syntax similar to English).
#    - Open-source and free to use.
#    - Interpreted (code runs line by line).
#    - Dynamically typed (no need to declare variable types explicitly).
#    - Cross-platform (works on Windows, Mac, Linux).
#    - Huge standard library + third-party packages.
#    - Supports integration with other languages (C, C++, Java).

# 3. Applications of Python:
#    - Web Development (Django, Flask, FastAPI).
#    - Data Science & Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn).
#    - Artificial Intelligence (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
#    - Automation & Scripting.
#    - Game Development.
#    - Desktop GUI Applications.
#    - Embedded Systems & IoT.

# 4. Python Versions:
#    - Python 2.x (older, not recommended).
#    - Python 3.x (current and widely used).
#    - Latest stable version: Python 3.12 (2025).

# 5. Python Interpreter:
#    - Runs Python code line by line.
#    - You can use:
#        * Python Shell (interactive mode).
#        * Script Mode (writing .py files and running them).

# 6. Python as Interpreted Language:
#    - Unlike compiled languages (C, C++), Python does not need explicit compilation.
#    - The interpreter directly executes the instructions.

# 7. Python as Dynamically Typed:
#    - You donâ€™t need to declare variable types.
#    - Example:
x = 10         # Integer
x = "Vamsi"    # Now it's a String
print(x)

# 8. Python Comments:
#    - Single line: starts with #
#    - Multi-line: use triple quotes (''' or """)
# Example:
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""

# 9. First Python Program:
print("Hello, World!")
